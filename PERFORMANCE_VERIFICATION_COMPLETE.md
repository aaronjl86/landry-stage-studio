## 🔍 Verification Steps

### To verify improvements, check:

1. **Lighthouse Audit:**
   ```
   - Run DevTools → Lighthouse
   - Performance category
   - LCP should be < 2.5s
   - Total Blocking Time improved
   ```

2. **Network Tab:**
   ```
   - Filter by "Img"
   - Verify logo images are WebP format
   - Verify hero images are AVIF/WebP (depending on browser)
   - Check individual image sizes < 100KB for logos
   ```

3. **Visual Inspection:**
   ```
   - Hero image loads immediately (no delay)
   - Logo images fade in smoothly (lazy loaded)
   - No layout shift (CLS should be low)
   ```

4. **Page Size:**
   ```
   - Check total transferred size
   - Should be < 2 MB on initial load
   - Subsequent loads should use cache
   ```
