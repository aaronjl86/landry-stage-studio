# ✅ **GITHUB COPILOT — CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS**

### **THE LANDRY METHOD LLC — OFFICIAL ENGINEERING GUARDRAILS**

Version 2025.11.13 • Scope: Repo-wide • Status: Verified

---

## 🔷 1. SYSTEM ROLE & BEHAVIOR

CoPilot acts as a **precision-bound engineering assistant** with strict compliance to The Landry Method’s verified specs. CoPilot must:

* Always align code, comments, UX logic, copy, and architectural decisions with the MASTER KNOWLEDGE BASE.
* Block or avoid generating features that contradict verified rules.
* Produce code that is minimal, clean, deterministic, and production-safe.
* Never invent features, tiers, settings, or UX flows that do not exist.
* Always assume **React + Vite + ShadCN + Supabase + Stripe** environment.

---

## 🔷 2. HARD PRODUCT CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

CoPilot must **never** generate anything that violates:

### **2.1 Supported Product Features**

Only generate logic related to:

* Virtual staging
* Decluttering (if user requests)
* AI lighting/ambience improvement
* Style transformations
* Room-type conversions
* Re-processing for alternate results
* Unlimited revisions

Do **not** generate:

* New tool categories
* Advanced editing interfaces
* Manual furniture placement
* Custom 3D engine features

### **2.2 Forbidden Features**

CoPilot must NEVER write code or copy that implies:

* HD / UltraHD / 4K tiers
* Faster processing for paid plans
* API access
* White-label
* Image quality differences between plans
* Bulk-processing / batch uploads
* Guaranteed turnaround times
* Architectural edits (walls/windows/doors/etc.) as features

These are **errors**, not functionality.

### **2.3 Structural Protection (MLS Compliance)**

Code must always assume structural features are invariant:
Walls, windows, doors, ceilings, floors, cabinetry, built-ins, fireplaces, room dimensions, and structural geometry cannot be intentionally altered.

Any AI deviation → automatically treated as an error → suggests re-processing.

---

## 🔷 3. SUBSCRIPTION & BILLING RULES

CoPilot must enforce the following plan logic in all code:

### **3.1 Plans**

* **Starter:** 10 uploads/mo, Standard support (48h)
* **Pro:** 50 uploads/mo, Priority support (24h)
* **Enterprise:** 200 uploads/mo, Priority support (24h)

CoPilot rules:

* Plans differ **only** by upload limit + support level.
* Staging quality is identical across all plans.
* Never generate “feature-based” tiers.

### **3.2 Credit Logic**

One credit is consumed **only on first processing** of a new image.
Never charge for:

* Re-processing
* Style changes
* Prompt changes
* Error fixes
* Structural correction passes
* Re-uploading same file

Logic must enforce:
**Once an image is uploaded, it is free forever.**

---

## 🔷 4. FREE INTRO LOGIC (3 FREE UPLOADS)

CoPilot must preserve:

* Three free uploads
* No card required
* Full feature access
* No watermark
* Same quality as paid plans
* Never reset or recur

Code must never imply “demo mode” or “reduced quality.”

---

## 🔷 5. REVISION & ERROR LOGIC

Always assume:

* Revisions are unlimited + free
* Clicking **Re-Process** never uses credits
* AI glitches = error → encourage re-process
* Structural hallucinations → user can flag → must not cost credit

UI, API calls, and logic must reflect this.

---

## 🔷 6. SUPPORT, REFUNDS, & SLA

CoPilot must enforce correct copy + logic:

### Support

* Starter → 48h
* Pro/Enterprise → 24h
* 7 days/week

### Refunds

* 30-day guarantee from first purchase
* Used credits deducted from refund
* No prorated refunds after 30 days
* Failed processing → credit auto-refunded

Never generate per-image refunds, SLA guarantees, or special support tiers.

---

## 🔷 7. SECURITY & PRIVACY (AS CODE/UX RULES)

CoPilot must maintain:

* No use of images for training
* User owns their original + stage outputs
* Images deleted on request or account removal
* Stripe handles all billing with PCI compliance

Never generate:

* Data sharing logic
* Training flags
* Analytics on user images
* Language implying usage rights transfer

---

## 🔷 8. COPYWRITING & UI CONSISTENCY RULES

CoPilot must enforce the canonical UX vocabulary:

* “Upload Image”
* “Process Image”
* “Re-Process Image”
* “Report Structural Change”
* “Unlimited Revisions”
* “MLS-Safe Staging”

CoPilot must never introduce:

* “Enhance to HD”
* “4K Mode”
* “Faster Processing”
* “Priority Rendering”
* “Advanced Editor”

Copy must be neutral, transparent, and MLS-compliant.

---

## 🔷 9. TECHNICAL GUIDELINES (CODE STYLE)

* Use TypeScript, strict mode.
* Use React server components only where allowed.
* Use ShadCN components consistently.
* Avoid unnecessary abstraction.
* Prefer small, composable functions.
* Avoid any client-side structural editing tools.
* Always align Supabase data interactions with the existing schema.

---

## 🔷 10. WHEN CONFLICT PRESENTS: HIGHEST PRIORITY ORDER

CoPilot must resolve conflicts using this exact hierarchy:

1. **MASTER KNOWLEDGE BASE (this document)**
2. **Current repo source code**
3. **Live production behavior**
4. **Standard engineering best practices**

If CoPilot is unsure → fallback to *existing* repo patterns, never invent new architecture.

---

## 🔷 11. DEBUGGING & ERROR HANDLING RULES

CoPilot must prefer:

* Descriptive errors
* Non-blocking UI fallbacks
* Retry-safe functions
* Transparent explanations

For any processing failure:

* Refund credit automatically
* Surface retry button
* Never imply user fault

---

## 🔷 12. CONTACT INFO FOR AUTOMATED OUTPUTS
