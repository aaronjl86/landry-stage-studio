## üìã EVERY FIELD IN BUILD & DEPLOY SETTINGS

Looking at your Netlify dashboard, here's EXACTLY what should be in EVERY field you see:

  - These options are for specific frameworks that need special build configurations
  - Leaving it as "Select" (unselected) is correct for your Vite setup
  - **Note:** Node.js version is controlled by NODE_VERSION in your netlify.toml (now set to 22, the current LTS), NOT by this Runtime dropdown

### Environment Variables Section
Should have these 3 variables (you already added these):
- VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID = lcwhbgfcyzefwnoblkkd
- VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = (the long token)

### Build Command
- **Command:** npm run build (from netlify.toml)

### Functions Settings
- **Functions directory:** LEAVE BLANK (you don't use Netlify Functions)
- **Functions region:** Leave as default (doesn't matter since you don't use them)

### Post Processing
All these should be auto-configured from netlify.toml:
- **Asset optimization:** Enabled
- **Pretty URLs:** Enabled

- **Minify CSS:** Enabled  
- **Minify JS:** Enabled

### Sensitive Variable Policy
- **Policy:** Default is fine (restricts build logs)

### Preview Server Settings

## üéØ SUMMARY

**Your site needs:**
1. Environment variables (3 of them) ‚úÖ
2. Build settings (auto-configured from netlify.toml) ‚úÖ
3. HTTPS (automatic) ‚úÖ

**Everything else:**
- Either optional or not applicable to your setup
- You can safely ignore settings that say "not configured" or "enable"
- Most features are for advanced use cases you don't need

**Your app architecture:**
- **Netlify** = Static file hosting only
- **Supabase** = All backend (database, auth, functions)
- **Lovable Cloud** = Managing your Supabase backend

This is a perfectly valid and common setup. You don't need most of Netlify's features because Supabase handles your backend.
