# Cloudflare Polish Configuration Guide
## The Landry Method - Image Optimization Setup

---

## üìã Overview

This guide covers the complete setup of Cloudflare Polish for The Landry Method. Polish automatically optimizes images at the edge, providing:

- **40-60% file size reduction** for general images (Lossy + WebP)
- **20-30% reduction** for high-value real estate photos (Lossless + WebP)
- **Perfect quality** preservation for logos (Polish OFF)
- **Automatic WebP conversion** with fallback to original formats

---

## üéØ Configuration Strategy

### Three-Tier Optimization Approach

1. **Logos (Polish OFF)** - Priority 1
   - Paths: `/assets/logos/*`, `logo.png`, `tlm-logo*`
   - Reason: Maintain perfect brand quality
   - Polish: **OFF**

2. **High-Value Images (Lossless + WebP)** - Priority 2
   - Paths: Gallery images, hero images, before/after photos
   - Reason: Real estate photos need high quality for comparison
   - Polish: **Lossless** with WebP conversion

3. **General Images (Lossy + WebP)** - Priority 3
   - Paths: All other `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
   - Reason: Maximum optimization for performance
   - Polish: **Lossy** with WebP conversion

---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Polish in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Log into [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Select your domain (thelandrymethod.com)
3. Navigate to **Speed** ‚Üí **Optimization**
4. Scroll to **Image Optimization** section
5. Enable **Polish**: Select **Lossy**
6. Enable **WebP** conversion: Toggle ON
7. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Create Configuration Rules

#### Option A: Import from JSON (Recommended)

1. Go to **Rules** ‚Üí **Configuration Rules**
2. Click **Create rule**
3. Click **Import rules**
4. Upload `cloudflare-config-rules.json` from project root
5. Review the three rules:
   - Rule 1: Polish OFF for logos
   - Rule 2: Lossless + WebP for high-value images
   - Rule 3: Lossy + WebP for general images
6. Click **Deploy**

#### Option B: Create Manually

**Rule 1: Logos (Polish OFF)**
- Rule name: `Polish OFF - Logos`
- When incoming requests match:
  ```
  (http.request.uri.path contains "/assets/logos/" or 
   http.request.uri.path contains "logo.png" or 
   http.request.uri.path contains "tlm-logo")
  ```
- Then:
  - Setting: **Polish**
  - Value: **Off**
- Priority: **1**

**Rule 2: High-Value Images (Lossless + WebP)**
- Rule name: `Polish Lossless - Real Estate Photos`
- When incoming requests match:
  ```
  (http.request.uri.path contains "/assets/gallery/" or 
   http.request.uri.path contains "hero-" or 
   http.request.uri.path contains "before-" or 
   http.request.uri.path contains "after-" or
   http.request.uri.path contains "/images/before/" or
   http.request.uri.path contains "/images/after/")
  ```
- Then:
  - Setting: **Polish**
  - Value: **Lossless**
  - **WebP**: On
- Priority: **2**

**Rule 3: General Images (Lossy + WebP)**
- Rule name: `Polish Lossy - All Other Images`
- When incoming requests match:
  ```
  (http.request.uri.path matches ".*\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$")
  ```
- Then:
  - Setting: **Polish**
  - Value: **Lossy**
  - **WebP**: On
- Priority: **3**

### Step 3: Verify Rule Priority

Configuration Rules are evaluated in order. Ensure priority is:
1. **Priority 1**: Logos (Polish OFF) - Must be first to override others
2. **Priority 2**: High-value images (Lossless)
3. **Priority 3**: General images (Lossy)

To adjust priority:
- Go to **Rules** ‚Üí **Configuration Rules**
- Drag rules to reorder
- Click **Save**

### Step 4: Purge Cache

After configuration:
1. Go to **Caching** ‚Üí **Configuration**
2. Click **Purge Everything**
3. Confirm the purge
4. Wait 30 seconds for cache to clear

## ‚úÖ Verification

### Method 1: Run Verification Script

```bash
chmod +x scripts/verify-polish.sh
./scripts/verify-polish.sh
```

The script will test:
- Gallery images (should show `cf-polished: lossy=true, webp=true`)
- Hero/Before/After images (should show `cf-polished: lossy=false, webp=true`)
- Logos (should NOT have `cf-polished` header)

### Method 2: Manual Browser Testing

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Visit your site: https://thelandrymethod.com
4. Click on an image file (e.g., `before-bedroom.jpg`)
5. Check **Response Headers**:
   - Look for `cf-polished` header
   - Check `content-type` (should be `image/webp` in Chrome)
   - Verify `cache-control` is present

### Method 3: cURL Testing

```bash
# Test a gallery image (should be Lossy + WebP)
curl -I https://thelandrymethod.com/assets/gallery/before-bedroom.jpg | grep cf-polished

# Expected: cf-polished: lossy=true, webp=true

# Test a logo (should NOT have cf-polished header)
curl -I https://thelandrymethod.com/assets/logos/austin-real-estate-opt.png | grep cf-polished

# Expected: (no output - header absent)
```

### Method 4: File Size Comparison

**Before Polish:**
- Typical gallery JPEG: ~800 KB
- Hero image: ~1.2 MB

**After Polish (Lossy + WebP):**
- Gallery JPEG ‚Üí WebP: ~300-400 KB (50-60% reduction)
- Hero image (Lossless + WebP): ~900 KB (25% reduction)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: No `cf-polished` Header on Images

**Possible Causes:**
1. Configuration Rules not enabled
2. Rules not deployed
3. Cache not purged

**Solutions:**
- Verify rules are enabled in Dashboard ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Configuration Rules
- Re-deploy rules if needed
- Purge cache: Caching ‚Üí Purge Everything
- Wait 30-60 seconds and test again

### Issue: Logos Being Optimized (Quality Loss)

**Possible Causes:**
1. Logo rule priority too low
2. Logo rule expression not matching paths

**Solutions:**
- Check rule priority: Logo rule must be Priority 1
- Verify logo paths in rule expression match actual file locations
- Test expression: Dashboard ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Edit rule ‚Üí Test
- Purge cache after fixing

### Issue: Before/After Images Too Compressed

**Possible Causes:**
1. High-value rule not matching paths
2. Lossy rule priority too high

**Solutions:**
- Verify paths in Lossless rule (Priority 2)
- Check that paths like `/assets/gallery/`, `before-`, `after-` are included
- Ensure Lossless rule priority is higher than Lossy rule (lower number = higher priority)
- Purge cache after fixing

### Issue: WebP Not Being Served

**Possible Causes:**
1. Browser doesn't support WebP (Safari < 14)
2. WebP option not enabled in Polish settings
3. `Vary: Accept` header missing

**Solutions:**
- Test in Chrome/Firefox (full WebP support)
- Verify Polish settings: Speed ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí WebP toggle ON
- Check `_headers` file has `Vary: Accept` for images
- Purge cache

### Issue: Slow Image Loading Despite Polish

**Possible Causes:**
1. Cache not properly configured
2. Origin images too large
3. CDN not distributing optimized images

**Solutions:**
- Verify `Cache-Control` headers in `_headers` file
- Check Cloudflare Analytics ‚Üí Caching ‚Üí Cache Rate (should be >95%)
- If cache rate low, adjust cache rules
- Consider pre-optimizing source images (origin) to <2 MB
