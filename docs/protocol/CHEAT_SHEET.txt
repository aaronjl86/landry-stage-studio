# LANDRY PROTOCOL v4.0 — CHEAT SHEET (Print This)

---

## WHEN STARTING A NEW CHAT

**STEP 1: Copy/paste into the LLM chat**
```
[Entire PROTOCOL_COPY_PASTE.md file]
```

**STEP 2: Wait for acknowledgment**
LLM must say: "I acknowledge that I have read and understand the Landry Coherence Protocol v4.0..."

If it doesn't, do NOT proceed.

---

## DESCRIBING YOUR PROBLEM (Critical Format)

**Use this template:**

```
Using the Landry Protocol in ICU Mode:

ERROR: [What exactly is happening/breaking]

FILE: [Paste the actual file that's breaking]

DESIRED BEHAVIOR: [What should happen instead]

QUESTION: [What specifically do you need me to fix]
```

**Example:**
```
Using the Landry Protocol in ICU Mode:

ERROR: Upload returns 500 error. Bucket not found.

FILE: [paste the upload handler function]

DESIRED BEHAVIOR: Upload succeeds and returns image URL.

QUESTION: How do I fix the bucket reference?
```

---

## ICU MODE RULES (Default)

1. **Show me the artifact** (no assumptions)
2. **One error at a time** (no scope creep)
3. **Minimal delta only** (line-level changes)
4. **2-minute verification rule** (testable before you implement)
5. **Halt on ambiguity** (AI asks if unclear)

---

## GROWTH MODE (Strategic Thinking)

**Activate with:**
```
Switch to Growth Mode. [your strategic question]
```

Only use when you want architectural thinking, not execution.

---

## HALT CONDITIONS (AI Must Stop)

AI must stop and ask if:
- Context is missing
- Artifacts conflict
- Instructions are unclear
- Solution can't be verified in 2 minutes
- Need to see another file

**AI should respond:**
> "HALT: I cannot proceed safely. I need: [specific thing]"

---

## CONFIDENCE TIERS

- **Tier 1 (Verifiable):** You can directly check it → Trust it
- **Tier 2 (Supported):** Based on your artifact → Verify it
- **Tier 3 (Inference):** A reasonable guess → Test it
- **Tier 4 (Speculation):** Guessing → Only in Growth Mode

---

## WHEN TO STOP THE AI

Say: **"Stop. You're breaking protocol."**

Then point to the violation:

| Red Flag | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Suggests code changes without seeing file | "Show me the file first" |
| Proposes architecture in ICU Mode | "Growth Mode only if I ask" |
| Multi-file refactor | "Delta-only fixes" |
| Unverifiable suggestion | "This takes more than 2 minutes" |
| Proceeds without context | "What's missing?" |

---

## THE LOOP (Repeat This)

1. **You:** Describe problem (error + file + desired behavior)
2. **AI:** Diagnose (artifact-only, no invention)
3. **You:** Confirm diagnosis or provide context
4. **AI:** Suggest minimal fix
5. **You:** Test and report result
6. **Repeat** until fixed

---

## VERIFICATION BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Does this match the file I pasted?
- [ ] Is this the behavior I want?
- [ ] Can I test this in 2 minutes?
- [ ] Does the diagnosis make sense?
- [ ] Do I need to ask for more context?

---

## IF SOMETHING FEELS WRONG

Ask the AI:
- "Do you have enough context to be sure?"
- "What else would you need to see?"
- "Why are you confident about this?"
- "What could prove this wrong?"

---

## THE PROMISE

If you follow the protocol:
✓ Catastrophic failures become nearly impossible
✓ Every fix is testable and minimal
✓ You catch errors before they compound
✓ You stay in control

Not fast. Not genius. But safe.

## REMEMBER

**The protocol only works if you enforce it.**
The AI cannot self-police. You must watch.
