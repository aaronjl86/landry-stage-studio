- What this protocol prevents (✓)
- What it does NOT prevent (✗)
- What you remain responsible for
- Failure modes that still exist
- Rebuild checklist
- **Use this for: Deep understanding of the protocol's limitations**

---

## 5. **FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md**
**The meta-analysis: where all four models converge.**

- Evolution of the frameworks (v1, v3, v4, v4 Revised)

- What the protocol prevents vs. doesn't
- The decision you need to make (ICU vs. Growth vs. Normal)
- The four questions to answer before rebuilding
- **Use this for: Understanding the philosophy and making your choice**

---

## 6. **Landry_Operating_Protocol_v1.0.xlsx**
**Earlier, more detailed version focusing on Landry Method domain constraints.**

- Operating constraints specific to Landry Method

- Red flags and guardrails
- "I don't know" thresholds
- Human override protocol
- Prompt starters
- **Use this for: Extra context on domain-specific constraints**

---

## 7. **Landry_Method_Workbook.xlsx**
**Operational tracking system for running The Landry Method business.**

- Prospect list template

## RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW

### For Your Landry Method Rebuild:

**Day 1:**
1. Read FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md (understand the philosophy)
2. Read Protocol_Quick_Reference.xlsx (know the rules)
3. Choose your mode (ICU vs. Growth)

**When Starting a New LLM Chat:**
1. Copy/paste PROTOCOL_COPY_PASTE.md into the chat
2. Wait for AI acknowledgment
3. Describe your first problem (artifact + error + desired behavior)
4. Follow Protocol_Example_Workflow.md pattern

**During Conversations:**
1. Reference Protocol_Quick_Reference.xlsx as needed
2. Use FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md to remind yourself of what's being prevented
3. Use Landry_Protocol_v4.0_REVISED.xlsx if you need to understand limitations

---

## QUICK START (TL;DR)

1. **Copy this into any LLM chat:**
   `PROTOCOL_COPY_PASTE.md`

2. **Wait for AI to acknowledge the protocol**

3. **Describe your problem clearly:**
   - What's broken (error message)
   - What should happen instead
   - Paste the relevant code/config file

4. **Let AI diagnose (artifact-only)**

5. **You test and report result**

6. **Loop until fixed**

That's it. That's the entire system.

---

## KEY PRINCIPLES (Remember These)

### The Core Insight
Don't trust AI to self-police. Trust structure to constrain behavior.

### Two Modes
- **ICU Mode (default for code/rebuilds):** Artifact-only, no inference, maximum safety
- **Growth Mode (creative work):** Full inference allowed, but only when explicitly activated

### Three Halts
The AI must stop if:
1. Context is missing (can't verify artifact)
2. The request is ambiguous (unclear error or desired behavior)
3. The solution can't be verified in 2 minutes (too speculative)

### Your Responsibility
- Describe problems clearly
- Test before implementing
- Verify every output
- Tell AI when it's wrong

## WHICH FILE TO USE WHEN

| Situation | File |
|-----------|------|
| First time setup | FINAL_SYNTHESIS.md |
| Starting new LLM chat | PROTOCOL_COPY_PASTE.md |
| Mid-conversation doubt | Protocol_Quick_Reference.xlsx |
| Want to see it in action | Protocol_Example_Workflow.md |
| Need to understand limitations | Landry_Protocol_v4.0_REVISED.xlsx |
| Deeper domain constraints | Landry_Operating_Protocol_v1.0.xlsx |
| Tracking Landry Method execution | Landry_Method_Workbook.xlsx |

## CRITICAL REMINDER

**This protocol only works if:**

1. ✓ You paste the full protocol into each new LLM chat
2. ✓ You wait for the AI to acknowledge it
3. ✓ You actually follow the protocol (don't skip steps)
4. ✓ You test before implementing
5. ✓ You stop the AI when it violates protocol

**If you skip any of these, the protocol fails.**

The structure only constrains the AI if you enforce it.

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

You now have a working system for AI-assisted rebuilds that:

✓ Prevents hallucinated code rewrites
✓ Forces verification at every step
✓ Makes catastrophic failures structurally impossible
✓ Gives you control throughout the process
✓ Works with any LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc.)
✓ Scales to your specific domain (Landry Method, code, content, strategy)

Use it.
