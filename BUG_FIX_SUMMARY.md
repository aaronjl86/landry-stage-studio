# Bug Fix Summary - Redo/Regeneration Credit Charging
**Date:** January 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Redo operations were charging credits  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Problem:** When users clicked "Redo" to regenerate a failed or completed image, the system was charging credits even though the requirement stated that regenerations and variations should NOT charge credits.

**Impact:** 
- Users lost credits for retrying failed images
- Users lost credits for regenerating images with different settings
- Violated the stated business requirement

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changes Made to `src/hooks/useAIProcessor.tsx`:

#### 1. Added `isRedo` Flag to EditingJob Interface
```typescript
export interface EditingJob {
  // ... existing fields
  isRedo?: boolean; // Flag to track if this is a redo/regeneration
}
```

#### 2. Updated `redoJob()` Function
```typescript
const redoJob = useCallback(
  async (jobId: string) => {
    const job = jobs.find((j) => j.id === jobId);
    if (!job) return;

    // Reset the job status and mark as redo (won't charge credits)
    updateJob(jobId, {
      status: "pending",
      progress: 0,
      editedImage: undefined,
      error: undefined,
      processingTime: undefined,
      isRedo: true, // ✅ Mark as redo so it doesn't charge credits
    });

    await processJob(job);
  },
  [jobs, updateJob, processJob]
);
```

#### 3. Modified `processJob()` to Skip Database Save for Redos
```typescript
// Save to database ONLY if this is not a redo/regeneration
// Redos should not charge credits or create duplicate records
if (!job.isRedo) {
  try {
    const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
    if (user) {
      await supabase.from("uploads").insert({
        user_id: user.id,
        original_image_url: job.originalImage,
        staged_image_url: result.editedImageData,
        status: "completed",
        credits_used: 1, // Only charged for non-redo operations
      });
    }
  } catch (dbError) {
    console.error("Error saving to database:", dbError);
  }
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test the Fix

### Test Case 1: Redo After Failure
**Scenario:** Image processing fails, user clicks "Redo"

**Steps:**
1. Start with 10 credits
2. Upload an image that fails to process (bad format, network error, etc.)
3. **Verify:** Credits remain at 10 (no charge for failure)
4. Click "Redo" button
5. Image reprocesses
6. **Verify:** Credits still at 10 (no charge for redo)
7. **Verify:** No new database record created

**Expected Result:** ✅ No credits charged

---

### Test Case 2: Redo After Success
**Scenario:** Image processes successfully, user wants to regenerate with different result

**Steps:**
1. Start with 10 credits
2. Upload and process image successfully
3. **Verify:** Credits decrease to 9 (1 credit charged)
4. **Verify:** Database record created with credits_used: 1
5. Click "Redo" button to regenerate
6. Image reprocesses with potentially different result
7. **Verify:** Credits remain at 9 (no additional charge)
8. **Verify:** No new database record created
9. **Verify:** profiles.used still shows 1 (not incremented)

**Expected Result:** ✅ No additional credits charged for redo

---

### Test Case 3: Multiple Redos
**Scenario:** User tries multiple regenerations of same image

**Steps:**
1. Start with 10 credits
2. Process image (9 credits remaining)
3. Redo #1 (still 9 credits)
4. Redo #2 (still 9 credits)
5. Redo #3 (still 9 credits)
6. **Verify:** Credits remain at 9 throughout
7. **Verify:** Only 1 database record exists

**Expected Result:** ✅ Only initial processing charged, all redos free

---

### Test Case 4: New Image vs. Redo
**Scenario:** Ensure new images still charge correctly

**Steps:**
1. Start with 10 credits
2. Upload Image A and process (9 credits)
3. Upload Image B (different image) and process (8 credits)
4. Redo Image A (still 8 credits - no charge)
5. Redo Image B (still 8 credits - no charge)
6. **Verify:** 2 database records (one for each original image)
7. **Verify:** Total credits_used in database: 2

**Expected Result:** ✅ New images charge, redos don't

## 📊 Before vs After

### BEFORE (Bug):
```
User processes image:
  Credits: 10 → 9 ✅
  Database: 1 record created ✅
  
User clicks Redo:
  Credits: 9 → 8 ❌ (incorrectly charged)
  Database: 2nd record created ❌ (duplicate)
  profiles.used: 1 → 2 ❌ (incorrectly incremented)
```

### AFTER (Fixed):
```
User processes image:
  Credits: 10 → 9 ✅
  Database: 1 record created ✅
  
User clicks Redo:
  Credits: 9 → 9 ✅ (no charge)
  Database: Still 1 record ✅ (no duplicate)
  profiles.used: Stays at 1 ✅ (not incremented)
```

## 🎯 Business Logic Confirmed

### What Charges Credits (1 credit each):
✅ First-time image upload and processing  
✅ Processing a different/new image  
✅ Processing with different templates (combined into one job)  
✅ Processing with custom prompts  

### What Does NOT Charge Credits (Free):
✅ Redo/Regeneration of any image (this fix)  
✅ Failed processing attempts (existing behavior)  
✅ Retrying after errors (existing behavior)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Credit Check Still Disabled**: The main credit checking logic in `AIPhotoEditor.tsx` is still commented out for testing. This should be re-enabled before production:

```typescript
// In AIPhotoEditor.tsx - NEEDS TO BE UNCOMMENTED
if (credits < uploadedImages.length) {
  toast({
    title: "Insufficient Credits",
    description: `You need ${uploadedImages.length} credits but only have ${credits}`,
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  return;
}
```

2. **Variations
