# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: How to Retry with the Fixed Code

## The Problem
You clicked "Retry deployment" on the OLD failed build. That just runs the old broken code again.

## The Solution
You need to trigger a **NEW** build that uses my fixes.

## üîÑ Here's Exactly What to Do:

### Step 1: Go to Deployments
1. In Cloudflare, find your project page
2. Click the **"Deployments"** tab at the top
3. You'll see a list of builds

### Step 2: Create a New Deployment
1. Look for a button that says **"Create deployment"** or **"Retry deployment"** at the TOP of the page (not on an individual build)
2. Click it
3. You'll see a form

### Step 3: Select the Latest Code
1. **Branch**: Select **"main"** from the dropdown
2. Click **"Save and Deploy"** or **"Deploy"**

## Alternative: Just Wait for Automatic Build

Since I pushed new code to GitHub, Cloudflare should automatically detect the changes and start a new build within a few minutes.

### Check for Automatic Build:
1. Refresh the Deployments page
2. Look for a new build that says "In Progress" or has a more recent timestamp
3. Wait for it to complete (2-3 minutes)

## ‚úÖ How to Know It's Working

When the NEW build starts, you should see:
- A different timestamp (more recent)
- Status: "Building" or "In Progress"
- After 2-3 minutes: "Success" ‚úÖ

## üö® If You're Still Seeing the Error

If you're absolutely sure you started a NEW build and still seeing the error:

1. **Tell me the exact timestamp** of the build that failed
2. I'll check if there's something else wrong

The error message shows it's using commit `5389298` which is the OLD version. My fix is commit `afb67e7` (the latest one).
