### Real Estate Disclosure Requirements

**Virtual Staging Disclosure:**
- Clients must disclose virtual staging in listings
- Recommended language: "Photos are virtually staged to help buyers visualize the potential of the space"
- Alternative: "Virtually staged photos"
- Compliance is client responsibility
- We provide guidance but not legal advice

### MLS Guidelines (Portland, OR)

#### Purpose
- Provide a concise reference for MLS expectations that impact virtual staging projects handled by The Landry Method LLC (TLM) in the Portland, OR market, which is primarily served by **RMLS™ (Regional Multiple Listing Service)**.
- Reinforce TLM’s commitment to supporting strict MLS compliance while clarifying that agents remain responsible for final adherence to their MLS rules and applicable laws.

#### Regional Variance Disclaimer
- MLS rules are **not uniform**; authoritative industry references confirm that requirements differ by MLS organization and by state/region.
- This section summarizes **RMLS-focused** guidance. It does **not** cover every MLS or supersede brokerage policies, Fair Housing laws, or legal advice.
- Clients/agents are fully responsible for confirming current rules with their local MLS, broker, or legal counsel before publishing listings.

#### Key RMLS Photo & Virtual Staging Standards
- **RMLS Rules & Regulations Section 3.8 (Photographs)** governs imagery:
  - Photos may not contain added text/graphics or alterations that misrepresent the property.
  - No people, copyrighted material, identifying/promotional info, private business names/locations, or Fair Housing violations.
  - RMLS reserves the right to reject non-compliant images.
- **Permitted clarifications** (must not mislead): lot lines, road names, arrows highlighting the property, names of public amenities.
- **Virtual staging disclosure:** any virtually staged photo must display a visible **“Virtually Staged”** watermark on the image.
- **Sample images for new construction:** if a photo shows a similar home, it must display a **“Sample Image”** watermark.
- **Coming Soon – No Showings:** the first photo in this status will be watermarked “Coming Soon – No Showings” by the MLS system.

#### TLM Commitments
- Design virtual staging deliverables that avoid prohibited elements (people, branding, misleading edits, Fair Housing issues).
- Provide files that accommodate required MLS watermarks or apply “Virtually Staged” / “Sample Image” text when requested.
- Collaborate with clients to clarify intended MLS usage so imagery aligns with RMLS expectations.

#### Agent Responsibilities & Best Practices
- Review the latest **RMLS Rules and Regulations** plus “Rules Roundup” notices for updates.
- Confirm brokerage-specific advertising or image policies.
- Ensure uploaded photos retain required **“Virtually Staged”** or **“Sample Image”** disclosures and that listing remarks clearly note virtual staging (e.g., “Photos are virtually staged to help buyers visualize the potential of the space”).
- Consult brokers, MLS compliance teams, or legal professionals for Fair Housing, advertising, or edge-case questions.

> **Reminder:** TLM supports compliance but cannot guarantee MLS acceptance. Final responsibility for MLS, brokerage, and legal compliance always rests with the client/agent.
